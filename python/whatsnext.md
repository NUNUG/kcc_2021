# What's next?

I hope you enjoyed this class.  If you have walked through the class and completed the Gobbler game but want to do more game programming, you may like to make some enhancements to Gobbler.  These are some ideas for things that you could do!


## Navigators
Add new ghost navigators to make the game more interesting.
- A sequential direction navigator, where the ghost will always
  choose right, then left, then straight, then repeat.
- A navigator which chooses the same last 8 directions that gobbler chose.
- A navigator to chase gobbler
- A navigator which runs away from gobbler.  For bonus points, this should
  be how the ghosts behave when they are in scared form.
- A navigator which chooses the opposite direction of gobbler
- A "back to the cage" navigator.  All ghosts should run back to the cage
  (in chomped form) when they are chomped.  To keep the game simple, I didn't
  add this to the game and instead make the ghosts immediately appear in the
  cage.  In Pac Man, they appear as a set of eyes then find their way back
  to the cage to to become ghosts again.  See if you can do the same thing.

## Add level start animations
In Pac Man, everyone is in their starting position as the word "Ready!" flashes and the startup music plays.  Then the
game begins.

## Add a score
This will require you to make the window larger.  Each pellet can earn points, power pellets earn more, chomping a ghost earns even more, and finishing the maze earns a big bonus.  Pair this with a maze reset to make the game play forever like Pac Man.

##	Reset the round
After clearing the maze of all pellets, you could reset the pellets and start a new round.

## Add more animation frames
Add animation frames to the ghosts so their frayed ends dangle as they move.  Make their eyes look in the direction the ghost is moving.

## Add a title screen.
Add a title screen with some graphics of your own or even some animations.  There is an MP3 with some music for an intro screen included in the assets folder.
