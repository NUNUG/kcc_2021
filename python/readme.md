# Kids Code Camp 2020 - Python
This is where you will find the source code and materials for the Python game, Gobbler.

## About the software

### The software stack
The software stack is what we call the list of software technologies and libraries we use to build a system.  Here is the stack that I used for Ultimate Fiction.  They are all free except for Rytmik:

- `Python 3.x` programming interpeter and runtime libraries
- `Visual Studio Code` code editgor
- `PyGame` game framework
- `Tiled` map editor
- `pyTMX` library for working with Tiled maps
- `Paint.NET` for graphics
- `Audacity` for sound
- `Rytmik` for music (not free - you could try Magix Music Maker Free instead)

### Installation Instructions for the MonoGame Class
If you just want to work through the class and write the code, you can follow these simpler installation instructions.

- Download and install Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition for your platform.  Be sure to install .NET Core 3.x support when it asks which components you want.
- Download and install MonoGame 3.7.1.

## About the Class

The class comprises 3 aspects.
- There are instructional videos for you to watch.  There are videos for setting everything up, videos for the game building and possibly some supplemental videos.
- There is source code for each step along the way that has been typed out for you.  If you don't want to type it, use the source code.  If you mess something up and don't know where the problem is, use the source code to figure it out.
- There is a RESET program.  This is a convenient way to switch between each of the steps in the instructional videos.  If you ever have a problem typing out the code, you can use the RESET program to move to the next step, or to the previous step so you can try again.

### Instructional Videos

I have produced the following vieos (subject to last-minute change):
- Windows setup instructions
- Mac setup instructions
- Tiled instructional video
- Paint.NET instructional video
- Audacity instructional video
- RESET program instructional video
- Game Coding instructional video
